Whenever a user submits a complaint, categorize it into one of the following groups:

- Policy Issues ("policy") → Problems related to policy details, renewals, or modifications.
- Claims Issues ("claim") → Problems related to claim processing, approvals, or delays.
- Policy Purchase Issues ("purchase") → Complaints about difficulties in buying an insurance policy.
